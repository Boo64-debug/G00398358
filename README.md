The Ionic Angular News/Weather App

This Angular app combines data from three APIs: openweathermap.org for weather updates, newsdata.io for the latest news, and restcountries.com for country details. The app provides essential country-specific information, breaking news, and local weather updates all in one place.
You can explore details about any country, like its capital and flag, catch up on the latest news stories for the country you're interested in, and check the current weather conditions for its capital city.
